# Image Denoising 
## Using AutoEncoders in Keras and Python

#### Overview
- We use autoencoders to perform image denoising
- Autoencoders are a type of artificial neural networks that are used to 
perform a task of data encoding (representation learning).
- We will feed in noisy images from the fashion dataset as input.
- The output is a clean (denoised) image.
